This project is a collaboration between the University of Calgary and the City of Calgary. Its purpose is to evaluate the use of LoRaWAN for acoustic monitoring in the city. The following are within the scope of the project:

- design of LoRaWAN-enabled sensor units
- algorithm design and implementation for analyzing acoustic data, both at the sensor level (end-device analytics) and the application server.
- deployment of the sensor network
- design of the application server
